K-Matter
========
K-Matter is a standalone mod that exists to serve as a replacement for the old Universal Utility Matter, or UUM, system that was in place within Industrial Craft 2, prior to its overhaul.  While not an exact copy of the system, K-Matter has been simplified and expanded upon.  Rather than using machines to acquire the matter, it is simply crafted. After which, you are free to make whatever compels you, or whatever you require.  The recipes are fairly similar compared to the UUM patterns you've known and loved, however I do reserve the right to add, remove, and change anything I feel is necessary to balance the mod as needed.  K-Matter currently also adds an additional item, K-Matter Infused Coal, which can be crafted by surrounding a piece of coal in a crafting grid with 8 pieces of K-Matter.  You can also craft 9 pieces of K-Matter placed in a 3x3 pattern at a crafting table to create an Uncolored K-Matter Block, which you can use for decoration.  I have plans for more blocks and items, and I will be adding them as soon as I am able.
